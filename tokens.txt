america
has
changed
dramatically
during
recent
years
not
only
has
the
number
of
graduates
in
traditional
engineering
disciplines
such
as
mechanical
civil
electrical
chemical
and
aeronautical
engineering
declined
but
in
most
of
the
premier
american
universities
engineering
curricula
now
concentrate
on
and
encourage
largely
the
study
of
engineering
science
as
a
result
there
are
declining
offerings
in
engineering
subjects
dealing
with
infrastructure
the
environment
and
related
issues
and
greater
concentration
on
high
technology
subjects
largely
supporting
increasingly
complex
scientific
developments
while
the
latter
is
important
it
should
not
be
at
the
expense
of
more
traditional
engineering
rapidly
developing
economies
such
as
china
and
india
as
well
as
other
industrial
countries
in
europe
and
asia
continue
to
encourage
and
advance
the
teaching
of
engineering
both
china
and
india
respectively
graduate
six
and
eight
times
as
many
traditional
engineers
as
does
the
united
states
other
industrial
countries
at
minimum
maintain
their
output
while
america
suffers
an
increasingly
serious
decline
in
the
number
of
engineering
graduates
and
a
lack
of
well-educated
engineers
